# Tier 1 Week 2 | [Video](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/1030114879/ec8a63ce53)
### Class Etiquette

- Show your faces (not required, but helps us put names and faces together)
- Mute your microphone when you are not speaking
- Feel free to ask questions through the chat window (or verbally)
- We will have time for Q&A at the end

### One on Ones!

Weeks 3 and 4, we will be holding one one ones with all students.
These are mandatory, it's a chance to check in with each of you. We will talk about how things are going and if you need anything. There is nothing you need to do in advance to prepare, just come ready to talk about how things are going so far and if you have any concerns.
You will sign up for a 30-min slot (the link to sign up will be in Slack Friday). The one on one doesn't need to take 30 minutes. They sometimes take as little as 10 minutes, depending on how the conversation goes.
- One on One will be done on video call.
- Reach out on Slack if you have any questions.

### Encourage people to work together

- Any planned study groups? 
  - create a poll for study group times
- This week's content (and going forward) will get more challenging, so please reach out if you need help.

### Learning Advice: Read, Write, Speak, Teach

- Dev's videos, documentation and tutorials are part of the "Read" skill
    - Resources: Extra learning, things to "Read" or reference.
- The assignments are the "Write" skill
    - You need to write code to learn it
    - Be careful not to get stuck in the "Read" state. Get into the discomfort and errors of "Write".
    - Recommended: Write Practice with less guidance and frameworks. Practice logic and problem solving in Javascript. 
- Study Groups
    - Work with others can help exercise the read, speak, teach skills. 

### Content Notes

- Week 1 covered tools and getting familiar with them
- mac/computer
- terminal
- browser/dev tools
- VS Code/editor
- git
- GitHub
- This week we are cracking open Javascript, which is a computer language, used to write web programs.
- What is a program? How does a "language" fit into that?

### Show

- Clone repo down, open in VSCode
- Sourcing a file
- Using console.log() to test
- HTML/CSS formatting, indentation
- Good habits: Frequent commits + clear commit messages
    - The reasons WHY
- Commit after each little step

### Assignment overview/instructions

- Review how to Fork, Clone & Submit 
- Explanation of grading
    - Reinforcement Needed - base requirements not met
    - Meets Expectations - You got it! This is a great place to be.
    - Exceeds Expectations - Holy cats! Good work!
- Remember that stretch goals are optional
- Remember to leave in broken code if you can't get it working so I can help get you on the right path
- Impostor syndrome reminder

### Q&A

How to earn a 5 on the assignments?

- Look to dive into more content and showcase/explore what you are trying to learn. This could be in html/css, which is the most visible way to express concepts. I look for an explanation (code comments) of the code that was written, not just what it is, but what it is doing. This is a great start to going just a little beyond what is expected. Have some fun!
